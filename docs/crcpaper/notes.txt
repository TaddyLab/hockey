(1) Here are some [other] papers on player evaluation that you may want to reference:
- Stair, Neral, Thomas and Mizak (2011). J of International Business Disciplines
- Pettigrew (2015). From the MIT Sloan Conference
- Mason and Foster (2007). Intl J of Sport Finance

+ Bobby added these to the end of a paragraph with other references on page 6.

(2) On page 5, line -15, maybe add some references wrt genetics and finance

+ Bobby thinks adding these would detract from the paper.

(3) On page 7, in the discussion vector \mu_i, state the total number of parameters

+ Bobby added that it is O(p) essentially, without getting too technical.

(4) On page 7, in the discussion of vector x_i, not everyone is familiar with
the Hadamard product

+ Bobby decided to make no changes here;  we explain that it means element-wise.

(5) On page 7, model (1.1), I have some confusion over the term p_i' \beta_p.
This vector should have the same dimension as \beta_S but the transpose in
p_i' makes this a row vector?

+ Bobby removed the transpose since this p_i should be a scalar.

The team parameter \mu_i vector makes sense to me since you have different 
seasons. However, the season covariate s_i also appears. I would think that
for a fixed season, once you have the players specified on the ice for a
given season, the team parameter is redundant. Some explanation in the paper
might be helpful.

+ Bobby added a sentence of explanation at the end of the "x" bullet which
  also mentions potential confounding between player-season and team-season
  effects.  That's a good point, since players change teams infrequently
  across seasons.

(6) This embarrasses me but I will ask anyway. I tried to confirm (1.3) but
I keep getting  \Sum_i \eta_i y_i - \log ( 1 + \exp \[ \eta_i \] )

+ Bobby says: this is correct; also see Gramacy & Polson (2012), Eq. (1)

(7) On page 10, line -5, ``sparse estimators''? Can you explain what you mean
by this?

+ Bobby changed the explanation, occuring right after "sparse estimators",
  from "with some coefficients set to exactly zero" to "meaning that many
  coefficients are set to exactly zero".  This makes it more obvious that the
  following phrase offers an explanation, and it also clarifies that sparstiy
  means lots of zeros, as opposed to a few.

(8) On page 10, the four scales in Fig 1.2 are greatly different. But without paying
much attention to the scales, the four plots don't look that different.

???  Bobby is going to leave this one for Matt.  Perhaps we should explain that the
shape is more important than the scale, which can be adjusted via lambda.

(9) On page 10, c_j is described as a coefficient cost function and an example is
provided. The cost functions on beta are given in Fig 1.2. I think there is
possibility for confusion. Some readers may think that the penalty term always
has the form of the example.

+ Bobby added the words "for example" on page 10, Eq. (1.3), and also added
  "in our particular hockey model (1.1)" on page 11, Eq. (1.4), so it is clear
  which is the example, and which is the particular choice we use in this
  chapter.

(10) On page 12, the AIC formula. I don't think you have defined n (the number
of goals in the dataset?) and k (the number of parameters in the model?). But
you actually did define k earlier and the number of special team scenarios.

+ Bobby did: n and K (the total number of parameters) are now defined earlier
  in the paper (K near the model describtion and n near the likelihood (1.3)).
  The text near AIC now explains that $k <= K$, since some of those parameters
  are zeroed-out under the lasso penalty.

(11) On page 13, maybe a couple more sentences or a reference might help some
readers. Something like saying that the posterior is the product of likelihood
and prior, and that on a log scale, it is a sum. So maximizing the posterior
to obtain posterior modes is equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood plus
a penalty term which is the log of the prior. Also, it might be instructive
to relate the prior to what we see in the plots of Fig 1.2.

(12) In Table 1.1, why isn't PFP recorded with the same number of digits
for each player. Also, should I be suspicious about all of the 0.6 entries?
Should I be concerned that in the rankings, players tend to follow themselves
but in different seasons. In this table, seasons like 20022003 would look 
better as 2002/2003 or 02/03. Could we squeeze in the player's team? My
intuition is that regular season PFP = 0.68 is too high.

(13) Given that the postseason results are unchanged from regular season,
might it be better to simplify the model and simply state that you 
considered a postseason term? Postseason performance strikes me a little
bit like the ``clutch'' player argument in baseball which I think has
been dismissed by analytics.

(14) Personally, I am not so sure about the preference of PPM over PFP.
A good player on a weak team would tend to get more ice time than an
equivalent player on a strong team, yes?  

(15) Returning to one of my queries in (12), I see that the Corsi ratings 
for a player in Table 1.3 do not result in a cluster of tied values for the
player. And your discussion of the omission of D Sedin and A Ovechkin
from the top of goal-based PPM also makes me wonder - isn't it agreed
that they are great players?

(16) Although I like the work very much, I was disappointed in Fig 1.4
which tells me that the sophisticated statistics are not much better (i.e.
only slightly more correlated with salary) than the widely criticized PM stat.
Can you say more? For example, could one say that GMs are making salary
decisions based on PM?

(17) The labor dispute argument does not seem well supported by the graphs.

(18) I like Table 1.4 and the related discussion. I am wondering if another
column could be added, something like the difference between the salary
expected by a player with such a PPM and their actual salary.

(19) This is probably too much but it struck me that plots of the metric
for a player versus his age would tell some interesting stories.
