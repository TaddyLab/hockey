(1) Here are some [other] papers on player evaluation that you may want to reference:
- Stair, Neral, Thomas and Mizak (2011). J of International Business Disciplines
- Pettigrew (2015). From the MIT Sloan Conference
- Mason and Foster (2007). Intl J of Sport Finance

(2) On page 5, line -15, maybe add some references wrt genetics and finance

(3) On page 7, in the discussion vector \mu_i, state the total number of parameters

(4) On page 7, in the discussion of vector x_i, not everyone is familiar with
the Hadamard product

(5) On page 7, model (1.1), I have some confusion over the term p_i' \beta_p.
This vector should have the same dimension as \beta_S but the transpose in
p_i' makes this a row vector?

The team parameter \mu_i vector makes sense to me since you have different 
seasons. However, the season covariate s_i also appears. I would think that
for a fixed season, once you have the players specified on the ice for a
given season, the team parameter is redundant. Some explanation in the paper
might be helpful.

(6) This embarrasses me but I will ask anyway. I tried to confirm (1.3) but
I keep getting  \Sum_i \eta_i y_i - \log ( 1 + \exp \[ \eta_i \] )

(7) On page 10, line -5, ``sparse estimators''? Can you explain what you mean
by this?

(8) On page 10, the four scales in Fig 1.2 are greatly different. But without paying
much attention to the scales, the four plots don't look that different.

(9) On page 10, c_j is described as a coefficient cost function and an example is
provided. The cost functions on beta are given in Fig 1.2. I think there is
possibility for confusion. Some readers may think that the penalty term always
has the form of the example.

(10) On page 12, the AIC formula. I don't think you have defined n (the number
of goals in the dataset?) and k (the number of parameters in the model?). But
you actually did define k earlier and the number of special team scenarios.

(11) On page 13, maybe a couple more sentences or a reference might help some
readers. Something like saying that the posterior is the product of likelihood
and prior, and that on a log scale, it is a sum. So maximizing the posterior
to obtain posterior modes is equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood plus
a penalty term which is the log of the prior. Also, it might be instructive
to relate the prior to what we see in the plots of Fig 1.2.

(12) In Table 1.1, why isn't PFP recorded with the same number of digits
for each player. Also, should I be suspicious about all of the 0.6 entries?
Should I be concerned that in the rankings, players tend to follow themselves
but in different seasons. In this table, seasons like 20022003 would look 
better as 2002/2003 or 02/03. Could we squeeze in the player's team? My
intuition is that regular season PFP = 0.68 is too high.

(13) Given that the postseason results are unchanged from regular season,
might it be better to simplify the model and simply state that you 
considered a postseason term? Postseason performance strikes me a little
bit like the ``clutch'' player argument in baseball which I think has
been dismissed by analytics.

(14) Personally, I am not so sure about the preference of PPM over PFP.
A good player on a weak team would tend to get more ice time than an
equivalent player on a strong team, yes?  

(15) Returning to one of my queries in (12), I see that the Corsi ratings 
for a player in Table 1.3 do not result in a cluster of tied values for the
player. And your discussion of the omission of D Sedin and A Ovechkin
from the top of goal-based PPM also makes me wonder - isn't it agreed
that they are great players?

(16) Although I like the work very much, I was disappointed in Fig 1.4
which tells me that the sophisticated statistics are not much better (i.e.
only slightly more correlated with salary) than the widely criticized PM stat.
Can you say more? For example, could one say that GMs are making salary
decisions based on PM?

(17) The labor dispute argument does not seem well supported by the graphs.

(18) I like Table 1.4 and the related discussion. I am wondering if another
column could be added, something like the difference between the salary
expected by a player with such a PPM and their actual salary.

(19) This is probably too much but it struck me that plots of the metric
for a player versus his age would tell some interesting stories.
