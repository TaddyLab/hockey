Data folder
======

This folder contains weekly-updated data files (in R's .RData and .rda
format(s)).  

The nhldesign.rda file is generated by buildgoals.R in the code folder,
and roster.rda is created by scrape.R.  Both are updated weekly.

The nhlscrapr_logit_data.RData file is a legacy version of the nhldesign.rda
file which is no longer updated weekly.
